# Better Job Interviews

Searching for a job and hiring a new employee have something in common: Both are frustrating tasks that lack a happy and all too often. With employee engagement and tenures declining over the last decades it's clear that something isn't working out.

My interpretation is that many people have a job they do not enjoy, work with a company they do not care for or are part of a team they do not like. As a result, we spend almost a quarter of our time given by doing something we do not like. Why do we accept this? In most cases, because many of us have come to the conclusion that this is normal and have stopped looking for better.

I don't think that this is good enough.

To start making a difference, we need to improve the matchmaking of employees and employers. A process that is more commonly referred to as "hiring". We need to _make better job_ interviews. As a result, we will find people who better fit in the company. This in turn will lead to more engaged and higher performing team.

This book is a collections of my thoughts, experiences and learnings on the subject on interviewing. If you have not done interviews before, it will give you a good overview of how an interviewing process typically looks like. If you are an experienced interviewer, there might be some interesting thoughts about how to prepare for interviews as well as how to ask questions in the book.  

What entitles me to write about interviewing? I've been quite successful building and leading a couple of teams in the last five years. The ideas and thoughts expressed in here will represent my own learnings and opinions. This is not the result of proper research. This is very unscientific - It is just my experience.

If you have any feedback - positive or negative, I _love_ to hear about it. Please feel free to post it into the [Make Better Interviews Linkedin Group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8718539/).


## Anatomy of a Hiring Process

Any candidate applying for your position will typically undergo these steps:

1. Application: the candidate has applied for a job directly or has expressed her/his interest in the job to your recruiter.
1. Review of the CV and motivation letter (if present): Someone will be looking at the CV to decide if that application could be considered for the position.
1. First Interview: This is sometimes done by the recruiter or by HR. It’s often a quick check if the candidate could be a match to the company. Often the candidate is asked for salary expectations at this point.
1. Interviews: Several interviews are held with the candidates. Depending on the position, some of the interviews will test skills while other will evaluate soft-skills, experience or fit to the company.  
1. Final Decision: After all interviews are passed, the hiring committee sits together and decides if an offer should be made
1. Offer: An offer (containing position, compensation, benefits and responsibilities) is sent to the candidate.
1. Signature: Candidate signs the work contract
1. On Boarding: Once the contract is signed, the onboarding of that candidate starts. Onboarding can and should start with some soft and nice parts before the candidate even started to work in your company. e.g. invite him/her to company events, give them some information about the company, share important news and successes. Basically do everything to keep the excitement up.  I consider onboarding extremely important to ensure an employee’s success in the company. At the same time, this part of hiring is outside the scope of this article.

While this is the general skeleton of an application, it’s important to know that a candidate can drop out of the process after any phase, when it becomes clear that the he/she does not possess qualifications to execute the job. What is even more important is to note, that a candidate who proceeds through all interviews should not automatically get a job offer.
Before an offer is made, all interviewers should sit together in a room and make a shared decision about that. I’ve seen many cases, where little concerns seen by one interviewer were either confirmed or dispersed by other interviewers.

Generally, a good interview process should aim at filtering out candidates that do not match as early as possible. This is also, why salary expectations are often being asked at the very beginning of the interview process. If no agreement on salary can be made, what’s the point of doing all these interviews?

When I started interviewing people, I felt bad about rejecting candidates. Instead I made the mistake of letting candidates pass to the next stage too often, even when it was quite clear that the candidate would not make it through. I’ve reverted my opinion about that. I work full time and have a kid at home. Organizing time to do an interview can be a struggle. Being asked to do this in order to find a new job is just reasonable. At the same time, it’s disrespectful of my time, my wife’s and my son’s time to invite me to interviews, where the decision that I won’t make it had been made already.


## The Hiring Manager

If you are going to be the future manger of the employee to be hired or you have the last decision in who is going to be hired or not, you are the hiring manager.

The responsibility of the hiring manager is to fill his/her vancancy with a fitting candidate on time and budget.  

### The Moralistic Aspect

There's a second, hidden, responsibility in the job: It's the responsibility to do _the right thing_. The person who signs with your company is putting a lot at risk to come work with you. At this time he can't do anything but trust that you told him the truth about the company and there was nothing terrible that was not mentioned in the interviews. It can require quite a bit of bravery to make this step. The least thing you can do is to ensure this person gets hired for the right reasons, that you are as confident as can be that he/she will perform in the job and fit the team. If you are not sure about this at the end of an interview stream - don't hire. I would argue that this is the only moralistic decision you can make.

Finally, there is one important thing to say: I do not believe that there is good or bad employees or applicants. Every human is a special being; we all have something we are uniquely good at. The difficult task is to find a space in which we can shine. This is as true for any candidate as it is for you and me.

### The Firing Manager

> With great power comes great responsibility
> (Spiderman)

It's important to remember that the responsibility for the hire does not end with having a contract signed. Once the new employee starts, the hiring manager's responsibilties are to ensure proper onboarding and to verify the hire. Having to terminate that person is probably next to the worst result of a hiring. Not only does this mean a big time and money loss for the company. Even more importantly, the person who surely suffers most from is the person who just got fired and might now have to face dramatic financial consequences.

It is - however - not the worst case scenario for a hiring process. The worst case is that a person joins the team who is a clear misfit. Maybe it is his negative attitude, maybe it is a lack of skills. Keeping a non fit around in the team can (and often will) make everyone feel miserable. If not corrected timely, that can lead to high performers leaving the company because they do not enjoy working with the team anymore.

I put a lot of emphasis on this, because for many of us who just got promoted to be people managers, the thought of having to fire someone is the most scary thing. It certainly was to me. For that reason, remember that if you start hiring people, you might also start firing people. It's not beautiful; nobody gets used to it; certainly nobody enjoys it. It's the worst thing that being a manager has to offer. Nevertheless, it's part of the job.

The best thing we can do as managers to prevent this is to do the best we can to take hiring seriously and to give people clear and early feedback when things are not working out.



## The Hiring Comittee

Deciding to hire someone, can be quite daunting, because of all the potential consequences of hiring the wrong person. For that reason, one should never make the decision alone. I recommend that there should be at least three different people talking to potential candidates. A lot of reasons, why several people should see a candidate will be found in a later chapter.

It’s the job of this committee to successfully fill an open vacancy. After all interviews for a candidate have passed, the committee sits together and discusses if an offer should be sent. There is a high risk in this decision for candidate and company, so this meeting should not be taken lightweight. I prefer to start by having everyone start to share his impression (highlights and concerns). Once done, we’d show thumbs up/down on the count of 3. If there is no common agreement, discussion continues until a decision is made.

It is quite naturally and healthy that during these discussion, a clearer picture of the requirements for the job will emerge. As you’re seeing more candidates you’ll develop a shared understanding of what to look for and what it is that you actually want.


## Kinds of Interviews

There are many ways to evaluate a candidate and come to a hiring decision. For this book, I will focus on classic interviews, in which one candidate receives questions or tasks from one (or more) interviewers and answers to them right away. I'll try to outline the most common ones below and give some suggestions in which scenario they apply or might be valuable. A good interview process can contain several of them.  

### Interview

A normal interview is conducted by an interviewer who presents challenges to the interviewee. These challenges are typically questions or short tasks. Not more detail here, because this is what the entire book is about.

### Task/Exercise

The candidate is presented with a task that he performs in front of the interviewer. The interviewer might interrupt him at any time to ask questions _why_ or _what if_ questions.  Often such a task takes 60-90 minutes. Finishing the task may _not always_ be necessary or even possible. The goal is usually to prove one candidate's skills by seeing them in action. Doing this in real time gives the opportunity to drill down into specifics, understand the candidate's way of thinking or just help him to focus on the right thing.

### Homework

The candidate gets a task as a written assignment that he has to finish by a given date. This task can be a bit larger in nature, and is often similar to the Task/Exercise interview. Once the task is completed the candidate presents his solution to the interviewer. This can be a quite effective way for candidates to show their skills and it definitely helps take out the stress of the exercise. However, homeworks _are_ very demotivational. You will not hear back from a lot of candidates after handing them out the exercise. This can be okay - depending on your industry or brand as employer.

### Meet the Team

If you want to ensure that the candidate is a great fit for the team, a _meet the team_ session might be the right thing to do. It is usually rather short. The interviewee will meet at least some people of the team over a coffee or in the conference room for an informal conversation. The goal of the interview is not only to ensure the candidate matches but also that the team feels good about hiring that person.

### Panel Interview

A panel is an interview in which the candidate is confronted with not one but many interviewers, who will ask questions together. This is a _very_ tough situation for a candidate, because every answer he gives is thought through by many people at once. And one of them is always going to find a _nasty_ question to ask.

I really like this interview for senior management positions where having to give good answers under pressure in front of many people with little time to think is not too unusual.

I would _never_ do this for junior positions because it's probably going to scare the interviewee. It's also a very expensive form of interview, because of the entire panel is kept busy for each candidate.

### Case Study

A Case Study is a special kind of Homework interview. It is most often used for highly senior or leadership positions. A business situation is presented to the candidate, which he has to think through and provide a strategic solution.

# Know What you want

## What are you looking for?

Someone in your company has decided, that there is a job position to be filled - and you are on the interview panel. In my experience, the key to any successful hiring lies in the preparation. Regardless if you are the hiring manager or just in the committee, be sure to have a clear understanding of the following points, before you interview anyone. Even more important, have a conversation with the interview committee on all these things to ensure you all share the same understanding.

### What are the key attributes or skills for that position?

Many JDs are very long and list a plethora of skills and experience as required. Unfortunately, people rarely fit such a shape. They bring their unique set of skills and experience, and you’ll never find whoever is described in the JD. You will most likely meet people that wow you. Not because how close they match your requirements but because of something entirely different.

To give you a personal example: I was once looking to hire a team lead. The team to be lead was very senior and responsible for a mission critical service. I was determined that “experience as people manager” was an absolute must have for such a team. Surprisingly quickly we found the perfect candidate, that wowed everyone. She fit perfectly with the company’s values, was a total cultural fit for the team and her technical experience just blew it. She had almost everything, except that she had never been a people manager before. She also had, however, the eagerness to learn and the humbleness to accept and react to feedback in a great way. We introduced her to the team to see if the team would also want to work with her (knowing that she had been a lead developer, but not a people manager before). Everyone agreed that she was the right choice.

We did hire her, and she thrived.

The are some conclusions to be drawn from that story. The most important one for me is that the right candidate will make you want to compromise. At the same time, it’s important that the hiring committee talks about such things. The understanding of what exactly you’re expecting from a position often develops over time. It’s hard to have that understanding upfront, but once you meet some candidates, it develops.


### How can we make the team better?

For this one, I like the sports metaphor a lot. In almost every team game, you have offense and defense positions. A great team it not one that only has a single rock star that everyone's supporting. Neither is it one that only has offense players.

Great team are a mix of skills; people who complement each other. If you’re looking to extend an existing team, think about which personality traits could add “DNA to the pool”. Are most people in the team extroverts? Maybe an introvert could bring a bit more relaxation and balance. Are people rather risk averse? How about looking for someone who likes a bit of thrill once in a while and will encourage people to get out of their comfort zone.

For a team of highly specialized individuals - how about a generalist, who can act as the glue in the middle.

Such considerations will usually not be the primary criterion, but being aware of them and having them in mind will give some input for discussion.

### What about Diversity?

People of different gender, age, nationality (or any other difference for that matter) working together do make a huge difference. Smarter people than me have written a lot about that subject. There is a lot of information about the benefits of diverse cultures at the workplace.

I will only say that I do personally not enjoy working in a monoculture. Therefore, I do encourage you to read more on that matter.

### Is the position set up for success?

There are so many jobs, that are created for the wrong reason. As a matter of fact, a book called “Bullshit Jobs” has been written on that matter. Ask yourself the question: is it fair to ask someone to work in that position? Will this job be relevant just half a year from now? Could you ever consider working in that job? If the answer  to any of these questions is “no”, then you’re probably creating a bullshit job.

Chances are, that people will not be interested in applying for that position, or they will not accept your offer because they’ve realized this already.

My recommendation is - don’t hire people for such kind of jobs. In the best case, you’ll just be burning a lot of money time spent in interviews or recruiting. Consider contractors for such things.

### Is Relocation an option?

This will often be decided by the senior management of the company. The result of that decision will however change the way you interview. If relocation is an option, think about how your interview process will look like? At least some of the interviews will probably not be done in person, because of cost and logistics to fly people in for these interviews.





## Your Worst Enemies

Hiring is not an easy endeavor. There’s numerous studies that show large portions of today's workforce being disengaged and unhappy. Let’s look at some reasons why hiring goes wrong.


### Time

When interviewing people, time is your single worst enemy. This is for two reasons:
On one side, people interested in jobs will not only interview with you but also with other companies. One the other side, there’s surely some sort of urgency on your side to close the position as well.
The longer your interview process takes, the more likely they get an offer from someone else in the meantime. Great companies can get from application to offer within one or two weeks. If your process takes significantly longer, you risk losing a great and engaged applicant to someone else.

Imagine, you interview with two companies (A and B) that sound both interesting. Company B sends you an offer. Both companies sound good to you, but you know that there’s at least two more interviews with Company A to go. You can’t be sure that you’ll pass both of them; and you can’t be sure that you can make Company B wait long enough until A gives you an offer.

Likewise, you’re interviewing with Company A. You think you’re doing really well and you’re rocking all their interviews. But it’s been a week since you had the last interview and you haven’t gotten feedback yet. Do you feel respected and valued from Company A? After all, maybe they are not as great as they pretend to be? Who knows that what they say about their culture is true after all? Are they running several candidates in parallel and wait for all of them to finish an interview stage? Uncertainty often yields negative thoughts. As a candidate, all of these question will decrease your interest and excitement about the company, making you sceptical, lose hope and interest. You’ll ultimately opt out. The day, an invitation for the “final interview” round comes, you might just not bother to answer even more.

Speed in interview processes can’t be overrated. In my opinion, the goal should be to get from application to offer in less than two weeks - ideally one week. That’s still enough time to give the candidate enough time to think about you as an employer. It also gives more than enough time to run four or five interview rounds with that candidate. What this will for sure, is give the candidate a premier feeling of being respected and valued. Proceeding fast with an interview process is a big sign of respect for candidates. Furthermore, I’ve seen a much higher success rate for fast hiring processes than slow ones.


### Priorities

If speed is that crucial in interview processes, how does it come that they still often take weeks or even month to finish? The answer most often is: priorities. The fact that your company trusts you to make hiring decisions means that you probably have a very important job and a lot of responsibilities already. Finding that time to do interviews can be a very hard task.

Your ambition should be that the interview process moves with the maximum speed the candidate is able to do. Practically this means that all interviews should be done at the earliest time, the candidate is able to do. Feedback for that round and an invitation to the next round should be done immediately after, latest the day after an interview.

Most of the time, there are people to support you. Recruiters or HR can and often will facilitate recruitment processes. Getting their buy in for a fast process can be crucial to achieve this. Give them access to your calendar (and keep your calendar up to date for that reason) so that they can arrange interviews for you without having to ask them to. Also encourage them to ask you if you would be able to move/cancel an existing appointment to accommodate for an interview.


### Hiring Pressure

Because there are not enough hands on deck, the team has to work extra hard to compensate. Everyone is stressed out and really desperate to finally fill that position to get some relief. In such a situation, it can be very tempting to give someone the benefit of the doubt, when doubt should is in order. You’ll hear yourself (or other interviewers) say things like: “maybe I am interpreting too much in there…” or “He was probably just stressed out in that situation. Once he lands, he’ll do just fine”.

When you are in such a situation, remind yourself, that the only way the situation could get worse, is by hiring the wrong candidate. Not only will a bad hire drag down the team morale, additionally, you’ll invest a lot in getting that person up to speed, giving him a lot of feedback and - maybe - replacing him in the end. That’s a huge chunk of work. When you consider the waiting time for the candidate to start, the time he gets introduction, the feedback conversations to be had, and then finally having to start hiring again - it can easily take half a year to identify and revert the situation, let alone running another interview process.

For these reasons, it is important not to lower requirements and expectations when hiring under stress. In contrary, especially in this situation you should be as thorough as possible to find a good fit.

### Toxic Thoughts

When hiring for a peer, subordinate or even for your future boss, there’s a lot of negative thoughts that might come up: That candidate is smarter than me - am I hurting my own career by hiring him? I don’t want anyone to get the job as my boss - because I want to keep my autonomy. I rejected the last five candidates that were presented to me - what will others think about me, when I also reject that one? That guy used to work in the company where Tom used to work - I hate Tom!

Questions like these do sometimes creep into our thoughts. Regardless whether we like them or not. My advice would be to ask yourself if you can be fair and non judgemental in that situation. If you can’t, tell people that you’re afraid you’re biased and would prefer to either skip that candidate or not be part of that specific hiring panel. Keep in mind there’s a big responsibility in hiring.
When you feel you’re not able to drive a car right now, the only responsible choice is to ask someone else to drive.


### Uncertainty

Uncertainty plays out in two ways against you.

Interview processes are inherently intransparent because both sides (company and candidates) do not want to fully disclose their motivations and reasonings. As an interviewer, you will probably never find out, how many other companies that candidate is talking to and what drives his decision to work with a specific one of them. This kind of uncertainty is innate for every hiring process; If not for being fast in your interview process I don’t know how to address this otherwise.

The other kind of uncertainty is the one, when you sit together with the hiring committee at the end of an interview process and are not quite sure whether or not to hire to hire a specific candidate. Most often there is either very mixed opinions about the hiring choice, or a feeling that there’s not enough information present yet to make an informed decision.

Personally, I would always opt for a “no hire” decision in that case. My rationale is that it is the job of the candidate to sell himself so that the potential employer wants to hire him. That there is uncertainty about how to proceed proofs that this was not done successfully.

This may sound rather hash. However I do believe that uncertainty is caused by either a fuzzy cultural misfit of the candidate (where nobody can quite put a finger on) or because people do not yet understand what kind of person they are looking for to fill that position. In either way, hiring that candidate would be a lose-lose situation, putting that future employee in a spot where he/she will most likely fail to impress.




## Work with Recruiters

Recruiters can accelerate your hiring process and find a lot of excellent candidates. Given that your company can afford them, as they will typically ask for 25%-40% of the annual salary of the hire.

As they come at a premium price, it is only reasonable to ask for premium service.

### What Recruiters can do for you

When working with recruiters, they will be the first point of contact with potential applicants. They will listen to what kind of person you are looking for, and what to pay special attention to (e.g. experience with a special software tool, but also soft skills such as empathy can be criteria).

Once they have a feeling, what company and job is about and what kind of personality you're looking for, they'll start their search. Typically they will either use social networks such as LinkedIn, or their own candidate pool.

They'll typically approach these people either by a private message or email, giving some teaser of what kind of position they have to fill. In the next step, they'll have a first call with the potential candidate which has two purposes: First, to excite and engage the person about that opportunity. Second, to do a first check if he/she can be a potential fit for the job. Most often, recruiters also ask for salary expectations and earliest join date at this point. This is to prevent bad surprises at the end of the interview process for both parties. If the recruiter is briefed to check for any specifics, that also happens in this call.

If the first call is successful, the recruiter will forward the candidate's CV together with his/her personal impression to the hiring manager.

From this this point, the recruiter will act as middleman between the hiring company and the candidate. He/She will schedule interview appointments, ensure the candidate has an overview on the happenings in the recruiting process and will respond to any questions or requests the candidate has. What sounds quite simple in theory, is quite a challenging job. Consider that you'll probably be talking to a couple of candidates - and each candidate is talking to you and several of your colleagues. In such a complex setup, things can easily become confusing and information can get lost. Can you remember a time when you never heard again from a company that promised to get back to you "the next day"? That's probably what happened. When the responsibilty of communication with applicants is unclear, balls get dropped. Interview invites are not sent, applications are not responded to in timely manner. Great candidates will go and apply somewhere else, as they can only assume they failed the interview.

### What Recruiters Do

While recruiters are a gift from heaven, they sometimes are considered quite the opposite. Which is a shame, because recruiters and hiring managers work on different aspects of the same goal: Find a great match for that vacancy in minimum time and for minimum cost.

Naturally, recruiters will always be advocates for their candidates as they get paid for signed contracts. As as hiring manager you know that it is impossible to prove someone to be a good fit. It's only possible to prove someone is _not_ a good fit. In a healthy environment, you'll get to a stable balance, where the recruiters will ensure you're not neglecting applicants for too little reason. On the other hand, they'll understand that hiring can be a big risk and therefore diligence is in order.

To get the best results, you can ensure that you are aligned on each other about what makes an ideal candidate. This starts by giving the recruiter a good briefing when the recruitment process starts. If it helps, introduce the recruiters to collegues that exhibit some of the characteristics you are looking after. Show them some CVs of candidates you'd find interesting or describe people you've worked with that produce stellar results.

As I pointed out before, your view of the job to be hired and therefore what makes a candidate outstanding can and should change over time while you are interviewing. Therefore, giving feedback continuosely helps a lot to stay aligned. Feedback should be given about candidates rejected (why was he rejected? what was missing?) but also about candidates that impressed (what exactly did you like about that person? Why do you think he/she could be a good fit?). To be realistic: most of the candidates will show some of the positive and some of the negative. Just because a candidate failed to convince you does not mean he had some traits you found very valuable. Tell the recruiter.

As with any feedback, it is most well received when it is respectful and honest.

### Finding a fitting recruiter

Like with any other profession, there is a lot of good and bad recruiters out there. Bad recruiters gained more visibility by excessively spamming people on social networks with clearly non fitting job offers. It's a shame, because this continuoues to hurt the entire profession.

There are _really_ good ones out there, though. When you can get involved in finding them, you should. From a candidate's point of view the recruiter represents your company. If you have a bad experience with the recruiter, you'll probably project this on the company.

Imagine yourself a single parent of two kids. To take the call with the recruiter, you had to leave work earlier, pay a babysitter for your toddler and cleanup the room from all baby toys before you can join the video call. Now imagine, that recruiter is 15 minutes late, tries to convince you to a position you're clearly overqualified, or you just never hear again from him/her after the call is over. How likely are you to ever consider that company again? Would you probably even tell your friends and collegues about the bad interviewing experience you made with that company?

So, how can you tell what the right recruiter is? When interviewing recruiters, I always give them one task: I ask them to pick any present or past client (they don't need to tell me the name) and try to sell me a job at their company in 10 minutes. If I end up being excited and energized, the taks is accomplish. Bonus points, if they did customize the pitch to my work experience. Solving that exercise gives me confidence that they can attract people's interest. Additionally, I ask how they usually work together with hiring managers and with teams to see if they are in for the continuous feedback model I am advocating. I conclude with asking them to describe me their best hire and about one hire where everything went wrong (think of fire alert in the middle of the interview, delayed flights,...) and how they dealt with that.

Once they start working, have a look at the candidates they deliver. Do you feel the candidates they present do not fit what you described in the briefing? Is the feedback you give not helping? Do mistakes occur frequently, causing candidates to jump? Do you end up talking to people that are clear cultural misfits very often? These are good signs that things need to be changed.

I can also recommend participating at least some of their acquisition calls with potential candidates. Not to evaluate them, but to learn from them. Doing interviews and getting information out of people friendly and efficient is the job of a recruiter. It's something he's as good at. Hiring managers are amateurs in that sense, having just a fraction of the practice in interviewing as recruiters do. Sitting with them in the early interviews will let you pick up some tricks and inspirations on how to become better at interviewing. It's a skill after all. What it also does is to give you an insight into the market to help you get a better understanding of their job's difficulties and how people can be attracted easily.

### Working Together

By now, you should have an understanding of how tricky the job of a recruiter is. Let alone the performance pressure as they work for commission. As they are doing an important job for you, it is only fair to make that job as easy as possible. Here are some simple things you can do. The beauty of them is that they will not only make your recruiter's life better, but it will also yield better results in hiring.

* Respond Fast: When you get a CV to review or when you just finished an interview. Return feedback as soon as possible. People who are applying for a job are usually nothing but patient. If they don't get feedback quickly they might just disengage. Returning feedback at the earliest moment you can allows for a leaner process that will be appreciated by candidates, recruiters and ultimately yourself.
* Respect their input: Recruiting is not your profession, it's theirs. Any advise received should thoroughly considered. Tweaking the JD a bit or broadening the search criteria for people might make it a lot easier for them to sell the job.
* Give Feedback about candidates. Especially the positive. Keep in mind that you are not looking for a "not terrible" but for a "great" employee. A great employee is not characterised by what he does not do but by what he _does_ do.

# Hiring Preparation

## The Importance of Preparation

By the time you get here, you've already spent a lot reading about theoretical and ethical aspects of hiring. This is, because going into interviews well prepared makes all the difference. The most important reasons for me are:  

* There's been a lot of evidence, that well prepared and structured interviews [can be 2x more effective in finding the right fit](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hrm.20026). Thus, reducing the amount of time and money spent in recruiting.
* If you come unprepared to an interview, most often the interviewee can tell. That lack of preparation can easily be interpreted as lack of respect or the company being a chaotic workplace.
* Having a structure and a plan helps you improve over time, as you will note what works well and what does not work well within an interview and can correct easily.

For that reason, bear with me for that chapter until we'll go into actual interview practices.

## The Interview Plan

Usually, an interviewing process consists of several interviews that are conducted sequencially for each applying candidate. This is, because there's many things you'd like to have certainity about before you hand out a signed contract. Things you might be interested in might be: technical skills, past experience, specific soft skills (e.g. communication), cultural fit, motivation to work in the new role or potential to grow over time. As all these things can't be reasonably figured out in one hour, several interviews are deducted.

The Interview Plan describes what interviews exist in an interview process and what their goal is. Many larger companies interview plans as policies. Meaning that you'll need to adhere to them. If there's no predefined plan, I recommend, sitting together with HR and the hiring committee to define one that will work for the positions you have. The idea is that all candidates applying have to go through all of these interviews.

At my previous employer, we had a standard interview plan that was to be used for all open positions. It would always consist of four interviews, carried out by four different people. Here's a slightly modified version of it. Please note that the order was not specified, so I am giving the order we used.

1. Passion: See if the candidate is a personable fit and brings the right passion and motivation for the job. It was a very enterpreneural company, so people with a "can do" and "hands on" mindset were what we wanted. This interview was to be conducted by HR, specifically recruiting.
2. Cultural Fit: Does candidate match the culture of the office. This interview had to be done by someone not part of the team.
3. Skills: Does the interviewee posess the required skills to be successful in his role? Interview was to be led by a senior domain expert from the hiring team.
4. Potential: Can the hiring manager see growth capabilities in the interviewee that will ensure future development and growth of that person within the company? To be led by the hiring manager.

While I don't think this is the perfect interview plan, it was worked reasonably well for us.

For each of the stages defined in the interview plan, there should be some (written) specifications about what topics are to be addressed. (e.g. motivation for job change was part of _Passion_). Having that clearly specified helps everyone to be certain that all important things have been addressed. It also helps to build a pool of interviewers over time. Without such a pool, hiring _fast_ is very hard because of interviewer availabilities.

### Designing an Interview Plan

How does one design an interview plan? In collaboration with others most likely. The Interview Committee, HR, other managers or experienced interviewers will give good input. Ask them to join a brainstorming session on the matter.

List all the things you want to find out about a candidate before and put them on sticky notes. Once done, cluster them together into categories. These categories will then make your interviews. If you have more categories than you can reasonably run interviews per candidate, filter them out or do multiple categories per interview.

Then give each of the interviews a name (because everything is better when it has a name), describe the qualifications needed to run it, and assign specific goals to each interview. When you start with this, keep it lean; you can improve over time. Keep in mind that the interviewer will need to be able to execute on that script within 45 minutes. Remember also that the candidate will want to ask his/her own questions and there is some time that will go into introduction and small talk.

> **Passion Interview (45 min, by HR):**
>
> * Run "Sales Pitch" to get interviewee excited about job.
> * Give overview about the company
>
> Questions to Ask:
>
> * Check if the interviewee is personable in the context of our company. Will he/she be able to get along with future collegues?
> * Is he excited about the opportunity? What excites him about the company/role he is in?
> * Why is he looking for a new job?
> * Is he/she self reflected on personal strengths and weaknesses?
> * What are his career ambitions over the next five years?
> * Salary expectation and possible join date

### The Interview Funnel

Once you've got your interviews defined, it's time to think about the order. Here's a bit of theory that will help you with that.

When you run many people through an interview process, the number of interviewees per interview stage will decrease over the interview process. All candidates will be in the first interview you run, while only a percentage will arrive at the last interviewing stage. At each stage, most likely fewer people will be interviewed than in the stage before. This is called the interview funnel.

**TODO: image about funnel**

Ideally, you want to lay out your interviews in a way that an equal portion of candidates are filtered after each stage. That will keep efforts and costs low on your side, at the same time it will ensure that people who are rejected have invested as little time as possible in the interviews.

There are some tradeoffs however. These are the ones I find most common:

If there are any hard, disqualifying facts, you might want to clarify them as early as possible (think of salary expectations or the will to travel). There's no point in running a person through four interviews, only to hear a "no" to such a short question at the end of the process.  

Interviews are expensive in general, but there will be some interviews, that are even more costy. Two examples are:

* Skill interviews for IC roles in a team that is critically understaffed yet very important for the businesses success. In such a case it might make sense to run the skills interview later in the process to put as little disruption on the team as possible.
* When a high level executive from your company wants to interview all applicants for a key position, it will naturally make sense, to have him interview last to protect his/her time as much as possible.


## Interview Structure

You are part of a hiring committee. You've got your interview plan and know what you're about to find out. How do you go from there?

As I've pointed out earlier, structured interviews make a big difference when it comes to successful interviewing. Generally, each interview consists of three phases:

1. Introduction
2. Questioning
3. Roundup

As I pointed out, preperation is very important. Nevertheless, I would recommend doing that preperation timely before the interview. That way, the questions and the concept is still fresh in your mind and the interview will come more natural. The perfect time to do this is the day before the interview. When you do this for the first time for a specific role, consider spending 1-2 hours preparing.

On consecutive interviews for the same role, it will most likely be only 10 minutes for each interview. Whatever you do, don't skip this prep. Undoubtedly you've been in an interview situation, where you were interviewed and your interviewer had not read your CV nor anything prepared for the interview.

What you will need to prepare is:

1. The input from the Interview Plan (to know what you should be asking)
2. The CV of the Candidate
3. The Internet or Colleagues who also do interviews, to give input for questions.

### Introduction

The first part of the interview is the introduction. The main goals for this part are to give the interviewee a human face to relate to and to help him calm down a little before the questioning starts. Relaxed people will give much better and thoughtful answers than nervous ones. Consider spending a bit more than 5 minutes on this.

In this time, you want to introduce yourself and have the interviewee introduce him or herself. Do some brief small talk with the other person before you start. Even if you are not the most extroverted person and do not value the concept of small talk, do it anyway. The goal is to relax the candidate at this point. Even if he/she notices, the chat is artificial - so is the entire concept of job interviews. It will help the candidate relax nevertheless. It will also show that you are not a "question robot" who does not care about the personality on the other side. They might notice it's hard for you to small talk, but you at least try to help them cool down. When you do small talk, ask things where it's obvious that the answer will not be rated. Also watch out to not ask anything personal. That can become inappropriate really quickly - especially as the context of an interview is highly formal.

To wrap this section up, give the candidate a heads up on what this interview is going to be about. This way he/she knows what to expect and that the interview is now starting.

### Questioning

This is the main, and most important part of the interview. I recommend that you prepare a template of questions for all people you ask. Then you make a copy for that template to customize it a bit. This way you will gather enough data to baseline candidates. At the same time, you will want to make some adjustments for individuals to address specific parts of their experience that might be relevant.

To get to the generic part, that all candidates are being asked, look at the requirements from the interview plan and think about what kind of questions might give you an answer to this. Always try asking open questions rather than closed questions.

A _closed question_ asks for a concrete answer. "Can you operate electric drills?", "Which Programming Languages do you program?" or "How many books have you published so far?" are all closed questions. They encourage short answers, like "Yes", "I know Java, C++ and Python" or "three". The answer from these questions often kills the conversation flow. There's little to follow up on them. And you can do nothing but trust the answer. You will not get an understanding about how well one can program, use an electric drill or how well the book sold after publishing. You will also not hear any reflections about how things went and what the candidate wants to improve on.

_Open questions_ ask for an explanation. "How would you build a table by yourself?", "Can you tell me about the last software project you've built?" or "What was it like to publish your last book?" effectively ask for the the same things. The candidate will however have to explain his rationale, his thinking and also reflect on how things went there. As a bonus, you can easily ask follow up questions: "You just said that you had a hard time to hit the deadline on that project. What would you do the next time to prevent this from happening again?".

Asking open questions has some benefits:

* You will more likely catch the "brilliance" or "genius" of a person. When saying "Yes" to the Electric drill, he has no way to tell you that he's also a really good woodworking artist and creates beautiful things of wood.
* You will not only learn what you are asking for, but also you can validate how well the candidate understands his/her domain because he needs to explain that to you.
* The interview experience for a the candidate is closer to a normal conversation and therefore more natural and more relaxing. If the interview experience is better, the candidate will also much more likely accept your offer later.

As a downside, open questions take much longer to answer. This means, that you can't really ask so many of them. When you prepare your interview's skeleton, don't plan for more than 6-8 questions. Most likely, you'll only be able to do five of them. Often however, will answers to one question also give you the answer to another of your questions. Therefore it does not hurt to have some backup. However, mark the most important questions for yourself to be sure you don't forget skip one by accident.

All good and well. Your interview plan asks for "Find out if candidate is a team player" now how on earth do you convert that into an open question? You can't ask "Are you a team player?" straight away. Not only because it's a closed question, but also because certainly nobody would answer that with "no" in an interview. A good trick to convert almost any requirement into an open question is to ask for a situation in the past where the interviewee has shown the desired behavior. Good team players will step back from their own goals to help others when they struggle for example. So you could ask: "Can you tell me about a situation, where one of your colleagues was struggling?" The answer to that question will reveal how the person felt about that situation and how he handled it. Does he understand that everyone struggles once in a while and that the performance of the team is more important than one's individual performance? Did he offer help by himself? Was he asked to do it? Or did he not at all get involved in helping that colleague. All that should give you a good indicator, if that person is a team player or not.

"Can you tell me about a situation, in which..." questions are a good pattern for asking interview questions. It's easy to take almost anything you want to find out and convert it into such a question. It also shows to work better than hypothetical situations. I would argue that hypothetical questions are too simple to answer because they lack all of the nasty context and detail that past situations from reality bring with them.

One thing that is commonly overrated is to review a candidate's CV with him. Iterating over his last few years of professioal experience. While there is some value in this, I believe in general it occupies way more time than necessary. If you've prepared your interview plan well enough, you know what you want to find out. Asking the candidate to describe his experience in general will most likely not give an answer to these questions.

Once you've got your skeleton done, it's time to tweak it for the individual. You will probably still keep your most important questions in there. Nevertheless, when an applicant brings a really rare and relevant experience from a previous job, ask about that too.

In case you feel insecure about the questions you prepared, run them through some of your colleagues or HR. This will give you confidence you're asking the right kind of things. And after all, once the interview is done you want to have as much confidence as possible whether to hire or to not hire.

This is the longest part of the interview, it will take the entire time minus 20 minutes for roundup and introduction.

### Roundup

The Roundup should start 15 minutes before the end of the interview. In this last phase, you want to give the candidate the chance to ask questions about the company, and give him an understanding on what will happen next.

Finish up the interview by thanking the candidate for his time and give him a heads up on how the process will continue. That heads up should include two things: First, when he will get feedback about success or failure of this interview round, second on what the next step or steps will look like. To be able to give a clear answer on this question, you need to be aware of the interview plan and you have to have a good understanding on how long your company will take to deliver feedback to the candidate.

## Preparing the Candidate

For this chapter, imagine yourself as someone who is right now looking to find a new job. You're probably interviewing with several companies at the same time. Some of which you'd prefer over the others.

In this situation you probably have three needs:

1. You want to know as much as possible about the company you're hoping to work with. Is it a place, you'd enjoy? Will the work be challenging? Do you agree with the company's values?
2. You would like to present yourself as good as possible. Not only to get the job but also to be sure, you're getting a _really_ good offer.
3. You would like to understand where you are in the interview process. How many interviews are still to go? Which interviews will be on site? How long will the interview process roughly take?

I would argue that it makes a lot of sense for a company to offer answers to these questions. As all of them are critical aspects to lead to hiring success, these answers should be given as soon as possible - ideally at the time when the candidate applies. Luckily, it is not that hard to give applicants support in these three needs.

If you have an interview plan, why not share a brief summary of the steps with the candidate? This can be part of the application confirmation or can be shared by the recruiter at the beginning of the process. That summary would typically contain a list of the interviews and their rough scopes.

To support the candidate to present himself better in each of the interviews, add the name of the interviewer, the topics (again) and - if required - prep suggestions to the invite. Especially when you're running a skill interview that requires any preparation or equipment, candidate will appreciate a lot when being told beforehand. This is particularly important for interviewing software engineers. When a programming exercise is part of the interview, send them a mail what they're required to have installed on their computer (e.g. Java Version 11, Maven, IDE of their choice,..). Otherwise, they'll lose precious time trying to get basic things running under high pressure.

You will also want to make sure that the interviewees get a good understanding of how life in your company is. To give a first impression, many companies put their values, their culture (and often the benefits) into the careers section of their website. Add pictures of the office into the mix to make it even better. Additionally, schedule time when doing on site interviews for having successful candidates meeting the team or giving them a tour through the office. Be sure, there is enough time to address their question after the end of every single interview. Coming from another angle, you might also want to excite them about the product or services your company offers - that they will work on. For that reason, share information about that to them. This can be content on your website, but also blog posts, articles or conference talks on youtube.

## Before the Interview

When I go into an interview - I always ensure to be calm and prepared. If the interviewer is nervous, unprepared or agitated, this does not make a good impression. Furthermore, the interviewee might pick up on these feelings and gets nervous.

I reserve at least the 10 minutes before the interview starts for myself, to go through the candidate's CV, put the questions I have on a blank piece of paper and to generally calm down. If I can, I sit in the meeting room already (where nobody is bothering me), if not I look for a quiet space in the office. I prefer to write my questions on a new piece of paper for each candidate, as this will remind me of the questions (the act of physically writing) and because I don't want to have an open computer or cell phone in the interview as I find this very distracting.

If the interview is via Skype, I send a message to the candidate 2 minutes before start of the interview. I also make sure that Skype (or what ever other tool) is working properly and does not ask me to install a version update. I wanna be sure that the tech is working when I am ready to go. In any case it is a good idea to also have the phone number of the candidate ready - a fall back I had to use very often.

If you have kids, I would also advise you not to do interviews Monday morning interviews. If you are part of the club, you probably know that kids _only_ get sick over the weekend and _never_ want to go to kindergarten or school on Mondays. Chances are, you might find your self arriving slightly late and stressed out. If you find yourself in these words, just don't schedule interviews Monday mornings. Everyone deserves better.

A last piece of advice be sure to know the first and the last name _and_ how to pronounce them correctly. Not being able to recall the other person's name in an interview is never appreciated.


# Running the Interview

## Introduction

You're sitting in a conference room and a person, you've never seen in your life walks in. Or maybe it's a Skype call? Interviews are artificial conversations that have a tendency to be a bit awkward. How do you start the conversation?

It is general wisdom that the first impression sticks, and that the beginning of a conversation shapes the rest of the conversation. If it starts uncomfortable and awkward, chances are it's not going to get any better.

In such a situation, candidates will realize that "it's not running too well" and get more nervous. Thus not giving the smart answers they could give you when being calm. When a candidate is in such a state, it's to everyone's disadvantage. You've both lost on an opportunity. For you representing your company, you're going to reject someone who might have been a perfect fit just because he was too nervous in an interview. Great matches don't show up that often, so you will most likely have to talk to 10 more people to find the next.  

Therefore, a good and nice start into the conversation matters.

As I mentioned before, your two goals here are to give a human face (yourself) to the company and to help the candidate relax a bit.

We've all been through hostile interviews. At the time, the candidate gets a call, he might expect just that. Start out by showing that you care. This is why I emphasize on the "know the candidates name" thing so much. If you are not able to pronounce the name correctly you can be humble and ask for help. Being an Austrian, working at international corpoates, I can tell you that everyone who asks me if he says my name correctly collects a big brownie point with me. Speaking more tactically, by admitting you need help, you drop your defense a bit, making you appear much more "real" and less like a question bot in the first place.

Take some minutes to do a bit of small talk - probably any topic will do. If there is something you found in the CV that interests you, go for that. I once had a candidate who put wrestling into his CV. So I said that I found this really cool and wondered how he would have gotten into this. It does not need to be something that specific. Think about something that builds a bridge to the candidate. Is he from Italy and you've been there once on holiday? If you are not a "small talker" and this sounds rather daunting, then rest assured that this is nothing mere than a skill. Once you've done it at 10 or 20 interviews, you get a lot better at it. If it helps, remember that the goal of this small talk is to help the candidate relax a little. They will appreciate your effort for sure!

There are some alternatives to the small talk to break the ice. Some people talk a bit about the company and some ask if there is any questions the candidate would have. Both are good things to do. Keep in mind however, that the candidate might have had a couple of interviews already. Therefore giving him yet another intro to the company might not really be that valuable to him.

To wrap up this phase, give the candidate a short introduction about the interview itself - what it is that you'll be talking about.


## Questioning

You went past the introduction of the interview - and now it is time for the questions. When asking interview questions, you _always_ want to extract as much information from the candidate as possible. Every bit will help you reaching a final conclusion. That is, if the answer you get is what you asked for.

### Asking Questions

There are several questioning techniques to ask for questions. I like behavioral questions a lot. In such questions, you ask the candidate for a past behavior that exhibits the trait you are looking for. I've introduced the concept already when talking about preparing the interview structure. As a short reminder, you'd rather ask: "Can you tell me about a project where you managed to hit a tough deadline?" than "Can you deliver under pressure?".

To get all the information you want from a specific question, it's most likely, that you've got to do follow up questions. To stay with the example above: If you ask for a project with a tough deadline, the candidate would most likely spend some time explaining you what the project was about. Them most often, he/she would go into how the whole team pulled this out together and how much of a success it was. That's not enough information yet. For all you know, that at least one person in the team was able to deliver under pressure. You don't know the candidate's contribution to the success. You also don't know the consequences of their action. Did they force it through but afterwards three people quit? What does the candidate think about how this project was handled? Maybe the decision for how to make the deadline was not his to make, yet he would have had a better solution. Finally, what did he/she learn from the experience and do different next time?  

This is where I would like to introduce two similar question techniques: STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) and SOARA (Situation, Objective, Action, Result, Aftermath). They are very easy to apply and help you get an exhaustive answer to all that you would like to know. You can think of SOARA as an extension of STAR with only one question added to the end. Let's look at how they work.

In both models, each letter of the acronym stands for a question you ask the candidate on a specific topic:

| STAR      | SOARA     | Question                                                     |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Situation | Situation | Describe a recent challenge/task/situation? (e.g. "Can you tell me about a project where you managed to hit a tough deadline") |
| Task      | Objective | What was the interviewees Task or Objective in that described situation? (e.g.  "What were you responsible for in that project?") |
| Action    | Action    | What did he/she do to accomplish the challenge? (e.g. "As the most senior engineer on the project, there must have been a lot of eyes on you, right? What did you do to ensure to stay on track with the deadline?") |
| Result    | Result    | What was the result? (e.g. "Was the project a financial success in the end?" or "What was the feedback from the customer?") |
|           | Aftermath | What happened after the project? What were the learnings of consequences? (e.g. "If you had to do that project again, what would you do differently?" or "Would you make the same decisions now too?") |

When applied, this model will help a lot to get information out of the candidate. Please also consider, that you might ask several questions for each of the stages to ensure you get a good picture. You can also use the model _as a spiral_ to drill down even further in specific subparts: Let's say the interviewee mentions that the project was under a tight deadline that was not to be missed, yet confidentiality was highly important. If you're interested in the confidentiality part, you could ask for why confidentiality was such an important constraint (situation) and take it from there. However don't start a new question thread before you're done with the current one. That way you can easily derail your questionnaire. You might not return to the original questions to finish up or - when you do - the candidate might be utterly confused.

Most likely, some of the questions, you want to ask, will not make a lot of sense as SOARA or STAR questions. That's okay, your questions aren't cats that love to squeeze in any box they can find. Especially, when doing skill questions, the model can become a bit ridiculous. "Can you tell me about a situation where a patient came to see you complaining about a cold?" - not working. Still try to ask these questions as open questions - seeking for an explanation rather than a yes/no answer. Keep in mind however, that you can use follow up questions nevertheless.  

### Question dos and don'ts

#### Help the Candidate to Thrive

When the candidate is in, you want him or her to give their "A" game as much as they want themselves to do just that. The reason is simple: If _the most perfect_ applicant in the world would sit in front of you having a bad day, you might end up not hiring him. If a clear non fit is having the day of his life, you will probably notice that in the process and never end up making an offer.

There's many ways to do that. Ensure he/she gets good directions about how to find your company. If you know a candidate is coming, prepare the front desk to know what to do with him/her. Ask if he/she wants a drink, take their jacket,... In the interview, accept the fact that people might be nervous and need some time more time to answers.

#### Do tough questions

First of all, keep in mind that your job in the question part is to prove the candidate does _not_ match. This is because you can't prove the opposite. Not any number of questions in an interview process will proof that the candidate will perform in the end. Therefore, it is okay to ask hard questions. Nobody is helped if that person eventually gets fired of the job within weeks because he/she didn't tick required boxes.

#### Take notes (immediately or straight after)

Most often, the final hiring decision is not made straight after your interview. So you'll need to remember the details of this conversation for a while. Most often, you're not talking to just one person for that job but to several. Telling them apart and exactly remember who said what can become quite a challenge.

Therefore write down some notes - either in the interview or straight after.

#### You can interrupt the candidate

Very often, candidates misinterpret a question and start giving you a long explanation of something else. Interrupting people _is_ impolite for sure. In this case it's a bit different. If the interviewee does not give you the answers you want to hear, they will probably not pass the interview. Therefore interrupting them, when they go off topic it is in _their_ interest too.

Please take this advice with a pinch of salt: there are many ways to interrupt people. Some of them are polite. Also consider that the interviewee might have gotten your question right but believes that you need to know some detail _before_ hearing the answer.  

#### Be Respectful

It's very likely, that you'll have a candidate who is utterly nervous, blacks out or just applied for a job without possessing the required knowledge. Whatever happens, stay respectful. I've had situations where a candidate we rejected recommended us to friends nevertheless.

If you are in such a situation where it is obvious it is okay to pause and ask the candidate if there is something happening. Alternatively, you can also mix in some simpler questions to give the candidate a chance to shine at some questions to build up confidence again.

#### Note the "Crap"

One part of my evaluation is if and how often candidates say something negative about past employers or colleagues. Obviously, they're sitting in this interview for a good reason so there must be _something_ about their current work situation, they're unhappy about.

There is - however - a big difference between saying: "the company is going in the wrong way" and "I don't buy into the direction anymore". The former showing a "My way or the highway"  attitude. The latter one saying that there is a disagreement. When teamwork is important, the cowboy approach will not work very well. After all, would someone who believes his entire previous company is misguided and only he can see clear respect feedback from peers? Furthermore: such conversations are okay to have with a good friend over a beer. But surely they are not another company's business.

Therefore, I listen for anything negative that was said explicitly or just implied. If I see a pattern, that's a flag for me to not hire.

#### Listen to your Instincts

There are times, when you do get the right answers from a candidate but _there is something_ you just can't tell. It's **very** important that you handle them appropriately. What your gut tells you comes from the experience you've made in your life - even if you are not consciously aware of it. You're indeed might be facing an unconscious bias but there are also chances, it's something else. Therefore, don't neglect that instinct, instead validate it with the hiring committee or with someone from HR. If it is just you, neglect it. If you all have the feeling there's something, be cautious.

I've had two rather dramatic cases where my instinct was right, even if I could not tell. The first person ended up not being hired, because he called our HR manager "chick" in the interview with her. The second person seemed a bit _off_ but we hired him anyways. Later I learned that the _off_ part were typical side effects coming from ecstasy consumption.   

#### Don't rephrase questions over and over

Unexperienced interviewers often do this: They ask a question but immediately are dissatisfied with it. So they'll rephrase, only to find out that they got it wrong in a different way once again - guess what? They'll give you a third version of the question: "Can you tell me of a project where you had a large customer base where some where hard to handle? How do you deal with difficult customers? How do you ensure that customers stay up to date with project changes?"

The problem with this is: There's no way to answer properly because there are multiple questions that essentially ask for different things. Consider the example above: one asks for a story about a project with many customers. The second asks for handling difficult customers and the third one for stakeholder management. It can be very hard to tell what the interviewer wants to hear exactly. Most likely they'll get it wrong and tell you something you didn't want to hear.

Instead, wait a second, think and then ask the question. If you feel you got it wrong, don't rephrase. You'll just make it worse. Wait for the answer, and see.

#### Don't go overtime

Keep track of the time. Remember that the candidate might have questions too. Prepare to end questioning latest 10 minutes before the end of the interview. You can time this a bit by preparing some questions that will likely have a shorter answer at the end of the time.

There's a couple of reasons, why this is important: First, being on time is professional and will make a good impression. Second, even if you are able to go overtime, the candidate might not (often it's already hard to make time for the interview call on it's own). Also keep in mind, that interviewers have way more time to get to know the candidates than the other way around. The 10 minutes at the end of the interviews is all the question time, they'll be getting. In the end, they need to make their decision if they want to work with you based on that

#### Don't use your computer or phone

It's a great idea to take notes during interview. However, please keep them on paper. Studies have shown that the [sheer presence of a smartphone lying on a table](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/691462) can be a major distraction. Let alone you talk to a person who is typing into a computer at that time.

Even if you don't mind, other people do - and it will make them perform below their capabilities. Leading to unnecessary false negatives and increased hiring costs.

The alternative is just to put your notes onto a good old piece of paper. Remember however, that by writing things down, you are recording personal information which is highly confidential. Therefore, be sure to keep the notes securely - or even better - destroy them at the end of the interview process.  




## Roundup

You've asked all your questions and there is 15 minutes time still. Perfect. Let the interviewee know that this is all the questions you have and tell him, you've got 15 minutes time for him to ask anything he cares about.

Be aware that this is the moment, when _power dynamics_ shift. Now it is you and your company that is under interview. If the candidate finds that he does not like the company, he will not sign a contract with you - even when offered one.

When you ask the candidate for his questions, it is always good to ask something like: "What are your questions?" or "What can I tell you about the company or the team?" rather than "Is there anything you want to know". The latter is indicating that questions are not appreciated. It can happen quite often that candidates are a bit exhausted at this point and don't have questions prepared. In later stages of the interview process, they might also have asked a lot of questions before. If the candidate has no questions at hand, it's okay to encourage even more or offer some information from yourself: "I could tell you a bit about how we work in the team, if you wanted?" or "The company has some really interesting history. Has somebody told you about that already?".

Regardless of the question, stay positive but stick to the truth. There's no sense in selling something that does not exist. Especially when using a recruiter that asks for 25% of the annual salary, imagine the tragedy of a newjoiner resigning after weeks because the job was nowhere near to what was promised. If this helps, think of it this way: not any person will fit in your company, at the same time, you will not fit in any company either. If the candidate comes to that conclusion - that's okay. _Someone_ noticed this would not work and pulled the plug.

What is very important is, to never tell the candidate directly in the interview if he failed or passed the interview. This might cause some discussion that helps nobody for one. But more importantly, telling a candidate he has passed an interview and then not proceeding with him might have legal implications in some countries. Finally, you might find yourself, changing your opinion about that in retrospect. This can happen - for example - when you talk to interview candidates you end up liking instantly. No problem with that. But at the end of the interview, you might be full of excitement, not seeing the negatives that were there too. It can take some hours for the excitement to settle. In retrospect you might realize that the candidate was not that great fit after all.

Finish up the interview by thanking the candidate for his/her time and letting them know what the next steps are. Practically, this means: when will the final feedback from this interview arrive (and on what channel) and how many interviews are lining up. Please be sure that the information you give is accurate. Don't promise feedback the same afternoon, when it will actually take a week to be sent.
